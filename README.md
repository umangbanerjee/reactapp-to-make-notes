## Overview

The React Notes Application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a clean and responsive user interface for managing notes efficiently. Whether you're a student, professional, or just someone who loves jotting down ideas, this application is designed to simplify your note-taking process.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Note Creation:**
   - Users can easily create new notes by providing a title and writing content in a user-friendly editor.

2. **Note Display:**
   - All notes are displayed in a list format, showing titles and snippets of the note content for quick reference.

3. **Note Saving:**
   - A "Save" button ensures that users can securely store their notes, preventing any accidental loss of important information.

4. **Note Deletion:**
   - Deleting a note is as easy as clicking a button. Each note has a delete option for quick and hassle-free removal.

5. **Note Searching:**
   - The search functionality enables users to find specific notes quickly. Just type in a keyword or phrase, and the application filters the notes accordingly.

## Technical Considerations

1. **React Components:**
   - The application is built with modular React components to ensure clean and maintainable code.

2. **State Management:**
   - React's state management is used to handle dynamic content, such as notes and search queries.

3. **Event Handling:**
   - Event handlers are implemented to manage user interactions, such as saving, deleting, and searching notes.

4. **Local Storage:**
   - Notes are stored locally using the browser's local storage feature, allowing users to access their notes even after closing the application.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Features

1. **Dark Mode:**
   - Users can switch between light and dark modes for optimal viewing comfort.

2. **Markdown Support:**
   - Markdown formatting is supported in the note editor, allowing users to style their notes with headings, lists, links, and more.

3. **Categories/Tags:**
