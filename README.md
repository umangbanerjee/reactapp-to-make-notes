# React Notes Application

This is a beginner-level React application designed to facilitate note-taking functionalities for users. Users can create, save, delete, and search notes easily through an intuitive user interface.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Note Creation:**
   - Users can create new notes by providing a title and content through a simple form or input fields.

2. **Note Display:**
   - A list of notes is displayed on the UI, visually represented as boxes containing titles and content.

3. **Note Saving:**
   - A "Save" button allows users to save their written notes, which become visible on the UI after saving.

4. **Note Deletion:**
   - Each note box includes a delete icon or button. Clicking it removes the corresponding note from the UI.

5. **Note Searching:**
   - Users can search for specific notes using a search box. The search functionality filters notes in real-time based on the entered query.

## Technical Considerations

1. **React Components:**
   - Create distinct React components for different sections, such as note form, note list, and search bar.

2. **State Management:**
   - Utilize React state to manage dynamic content like notes and search queries.

3. **Event Handling:**
   - Implement event handlers for actions like saving and deleting notes.

4. **Local Storage:**
   - Consider using local storage to persist user notes across page refreshes.

5. **Routing (Optional):**
   - Advanced implementations may include routing to segregate views like home, notes, and search.

## Submission Guidelines

1. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Create a public GitHub repository for the project.

2. **Readme File:**
   - Include a detailed readme with instructions on running the project locally and an overview of its features.

3. **Code Structure:**
   - Organize code into clear and concise components, using comments for clarity.

4. **Styling:**
   - Apply consistent and organized styling, either through CSS or a styling library like styled-components.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application using platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## Project Extras (Optional)

1. **Dark Mode:**
   - Implement a dark mode feature for users preferring a darker color scheme.

2. **Markdown Support:**
   - Allow users to write notes using Markdown for enhanced text formatting.

3. **Categories/Tags:**
   - Add the ability for users to categorize or tag their notes.

4. **Collaborative Notes (Advanced):**
   - Implement a feature enabling multiple users to collaborate on the same note in real-time.
